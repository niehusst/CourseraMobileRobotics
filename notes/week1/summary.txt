Model is something that describes how a system changes over time. Controls help us influence that change.
Differential equations represent our model.


There are a couple of ways to solve dynamical models:

1. Numerically
taylor expansion helps us approximate differential equations. e.g.

x(t) = 2x   (continuous time)
x_k+1 = x_k + (delta_t * dx/dt) + 2nd deriv + ....

simplifies:
x_k+1 = 2*x_k   (discrete time)


Sometimes an initial state is included to; 
x(0) = 10

Together, these equations are called a dynamical model


2. Analytically
To a differential equation can sometimes be solved with integration. e.g:
x(t) = 2x   ===   dx/dt = 2x
dx/x = 2dt
 /\           /\
 | (1/x)dx =  | 2dt
\/           \/
ln(x) = 2t + C
x(t) = C*e^(2*t)

since we know x(0) = 10; we can substitute to solve for C
ln(x(0)) = 2*0 + C
ln(10) = C



To check candidate solution equations to dynamicall equations, you can perform a check of the initial condition (if you have one) and check that the deriv of the candidate is equal to the discrete time equation.


The equilibrium point of a model is where x(t) = 0
