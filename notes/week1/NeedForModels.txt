models as abstractions of control

The main question of control theory is how to pick the input signal?
--- OBJECTIVES: ---
stability: system doesn't fail
tracking: following reference signals
robustness: ability to handle messy/unexpected signals
disturbance rejection: ability to deal with sudden environment/input change
optimality: how to get best performance (best subjective)


Effective control strats rely on predictive models.
A difference equation predicts the "next" thing in a sequence. This is what we do in basic math stuff (discrete time models).
We will be using differential equations more as they relate changes (over time) to the state of the system.

Models will be in differential equation models, but need to be converted to discrete models for the computer to interpret.
In some simple situations, the Taylor approximation can be used to convert continuous to discrete time.
