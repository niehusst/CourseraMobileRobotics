We will solve the rendezvous problem

Given a collection of mobile agents who can only measure the relative displacement of their neighbors (no GPS)
We want all the robots to meet in the same place

x_dot_i = sum(x_j - x_i)
x_dot = -L*x       # L is graph Laplacian
x = [ x1 ... xN ]

If graph is connected, the graph Laplacian L has 1 eigen value that is 0 and the rest are positive.
Since the L above is negative, then there are no positive eigen values; and system is griitically stable.

The above equation is called the concessus equation.
It makes agents agree/converge

x_i -> a, for all i   
      (aka)   
(x_i - x_j) -> 0 for all i,j 



This is a sort of special case critical system, because there is only one 0 value eigen value, it points in the direction of the null space (all values mapped to 0), which simulates an asymptotically decayed output; keeping the mobile agents on the right track.
