In an LTI model, 
   x is state
   y is output
   u is input

x_dot = A*x + B*u
y = C*x

A is generally defined by the laws of physics (we can't change it much). B and C are usually up to us and can be influenced by how well we can control our input and state.

How shoudl input be selected?
How can we pick u given y?


__ Convert Car model to State-Space __
Car model:
v_dot = (c/m)*u - gamma*v

say our state is x = [[ p ]
                      [ v ]]

A = -gamma =>  [[ 0    1   ]
                [ 0 -gamma ]]

B = c/m    =>  [[  0  ]
                [ c/m ]]

C = 1      =>  [ 1 0 ]



LTI systems are good approximations, but since they are linear, they cannot take into account things like sin/cos trig stuff.

But, for phi << 1
cos(phi) = 1
sin(phi) = phi
