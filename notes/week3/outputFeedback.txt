Output feedback is taking the output of a system, and using it to give input back into the system.

For a simple point mass robot with position p and acceleration u (p_dot_dot == u)

x_dot = [[ 0 1 ] * x + [[ 0 ] * u
         [ 0 0 ]]       [ 1 ]]
            A             B

y = [ 1 0 ] * x
       C

If we make the goal to move towards the origin; notice
u > 0 if y < 0 (desired behavior)
u < 0 if y > 0

A simple controler that would accomplish this is u=-y
(general form)
u = -k*y = -k*C*x

x_dot = A*x + B*u 
      = A*x - B*k*C*x
      = (A - B*k*C)*x
           A_hat

The big matrix math chunk can just be simplified to a new coefficient matrix, A.
Thus, if possible, pick k such that:
Real(eig) < 0 for all eigenvalues of (A-B*k*C)

However, building a controler using only the output will at best lead to a critically stable system that often can't fully do what we want it to.

To completely stabalize a system, we need to operate on ALL the state parameters.
