Given some behaviors, how should they be combined? Using hard switching or blending???

--------SWITCHING-----------
- pros
performance guarentees in each behavior
can be smoothed by adding an induced mode

- cons
bumpy ride w/o induced mode
possibility of zeno

---------BLENDING-----------
- pros
smoother ride, no sudden switching
no zeno possibilty

- cons
no guarentee that system does both things we intended




a standard way of blending behaviors (using vector dynamics) is 

sigma = 1 - e^(-B*d_0)
u = behavior1 + sigma*behavior2
