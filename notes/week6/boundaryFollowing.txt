Boundary following is the behavior of maintaining a constant distance to the obstacle/wall it is following.

A wall following vector can be calculated as a 90 degree rotation of the avoid-obstacles vector.
But which way should the robot go? There is no way to know what the best way from local information, so generally the gtg behavior will push the decision in 1 direction by finding the smaller of the angle between gtg vector and the wall-follow vector and turning in that direction.

We just take the inner product of gtg and wall-follow_clockwise, if its positive, turn clockwise. If inner product with wall-follow_counterclockwise is positive turn cc.

inner prod u_ao, u_gtg ==
u_ao(transposed) * u_gtg

But when do we switch away from the wall following mode? we dont want to just continue following the wall forever.
