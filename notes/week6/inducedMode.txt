The wall-following behavior can be described as
u_wall = a*R*(±π/2) * u_avoid_obst
where R is the rotation matrix (for going cw or ccw)

The induced mode equation could be used to compute 'a' and the sign of π/2 in the u_wall equation, but that's messy, so we usually just pick a value for a and use the inner product test to choose the sign.
We want to continue following the wall until it is safe to go directly towards to goal again.

You should start going to the goal again when the robot is both closer to the goal than when it started sliding and when there is a clear shot to the goal.

The gaurd switch for exiting the induced sliding mode should mathematically be:
||x-x_g|| < ||x(t)-x_g||   #curr pos < slide strt pos
u_ao^T * u_gtg > 0

Often, just to guarentee a robot doesnt crash into things while sliding at a constant ∆ from the wall, we add in a pure obstacle avoidance beahvior into the robot control system too, if the distance from the the obstacle is ever less than ∆ (exitted as soon as distance is ∆ again)

Last of all, dont' forget to add a mode that handles actually arriving at the destination.
