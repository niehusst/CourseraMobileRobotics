Controllability of the system determines whether we can do pole placement.
Controllability depends on the B matrix (which is given by the actuators/hardware of our system)


We want to solve

x* = [ B  AB  ...  A^(n-1)B ] [[ u_(n-1) ]
               ^               [   ...   ]
      gamma matrix (n x mn)    [   u_1   ]
                               [   u_0   ]]

This system is only possible to solve for any target state iff rank(gamma) == n
gamma is also known as the controllability matrix.

A linear LTI system is Completely Controllable (CC) if it is possible to go from any initial state to any final state. (while this may get us from 1 point to any another, it does not mean we can take any direction/heading)

CC Theorem 1: The system is CC iff rank(gamma) = n


___ EXAMPLES ___
1.
x_dot = [[ 2 0 ] * x + [[ 1 ] * u
         [ 1 1 ]]       [ 1 ]]
n = 2   #num rows in B
gamma = [ B  AB ]  #since n==2 only 2 entries of gamma

Calculating AB, we find that 
gamma = [[ 1 2 ]
         [ 1 2 ]]
Since the column vectors point in the same direction, (aka are not linearly independent) the rank is 1. 1 < n, so this system is not controllable


2. 
x_dot = [[ 0 1 ] * x + [[ 0 ] * u
         [ 0 0 ]]       [ 1 ]]
n = 2 
gamma = [ B  AB ] 

Calculating AB, we find that 
gamma = [[ 0 1 ]
         [ 1 0 ]]
Since all the column vectors point in the diff directions, the rank is 2. 2 == n, so this system is controllable


CC Theorem 2: Pole-placement to arbitrary eigenvalues is possible iff the system is CC.


___ In MATLAB ___

G = ctrb(A,B);
rank(G) == size(B)[2]
