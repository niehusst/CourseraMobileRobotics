Just like controlabilty, we find a matrix Omega, the observability matrix.

Omega = [[   C    ]
         [   CA   ]
         [   ...  ]
         [ CA_n-1 ]]

CO Theorem 1: Omega is Completely Observable (CO) iff Omega is full rank (aka rank(Omega)==n).

CO Theorem 2: Pole placement to arbitrary eig vals is only possible if Omega is CO.

Now we only have to put together the controllabilty and observability to make a full system that is only dependent on the output y measurements that we DO know.
