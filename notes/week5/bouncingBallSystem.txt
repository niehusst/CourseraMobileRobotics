Hybrid system of bouncing ball

System between bounces (in air)
h_dot_dot = -g (gravity)
x_dot = [[ 0 1 ] * x + [[  0 ] 
         [ 0 0 ]]       [ -g ]]
y = [ 1 0 ] * x

System changes (resets) while on the ground
h_dot = -gamma * h_dot   
#models ball velocity changing direction and loses some gamma fraction of energy each bounce
x = [[ 1    0   ] * x
     [ 0 -gamma ]]
         R
The reset matrix changes the state of the ball on dynamics switch.

since this "hybrid" system only has 1 behavior, it will switch to itself, but reset on a guard condition.


       +-------------+  x \in G
       |             |  [ 1 0 ]*x <= 0 and h_dot <= 0
 +-----+---------+   |  # aka height <= 0 and
 | in_air system |   |  # the velocity is negative
 +---------------+   |
       ^             |
       +-------------+  x=Rx


Using LTI system techniques, we can calculate the equation for the bounces as T->inf

T_inf = 2*v / g * 1/(1-gamma)
Since all these inputs can compute to a real value time (ie not inf) it takes less than infinite time to do infinite bounces with this hybrid system. 
Thus the model has undefined behavior at the time past the above equation; which is a big problem for long running systems.
Since time doesn't go to infinite, we cant have asymtotic system stability.

Where we have infinitely many actions (switches) in less than infinite time is known as the Zeno Phenomenon.
