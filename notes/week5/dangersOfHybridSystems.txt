Even with hybrid automata, we can't handle everything.

What can go wrong with switching between behaviors?

Given 2 stable systems; when combined, the resulting hybrid system CAN be UNSTABLE when used together.
So we can't rely on all the modes of a hybrid system being stable to make the hybrid system stable in everycase.

A hybrid system without resets is called a switched system where the switch signal (sigma) dictates the distrete mode the system is in.

There are difernt kinds of stability:
universal asympt stability: for all sigma, the syst is stable
existential asympt stability: there exists some sigma such that syst is stable
hybrid asympt stability: there is exactly 1 sigma (generated by hybrid switch syst) that leads to stability

If all modes in a hybrid syst are stable, then the hybrid syst is at least existentialy stable (it could just never switch mode)
There is no easy way to design universally stable systems

The best we can usually do is to design stable modes and TEST the poop out of the hybrid switching logic of the controller.
