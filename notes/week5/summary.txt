Type1 zeno is infinite switching at a certain condition caused by the guard conditions.
It occurs when Lf1g < 0 && Lf2g > 0 at a specific value for g(x)=0. (aka, 2 behavior functions are pointing in opposite directions at a single point)

When type1 zeno is found, we want to add a Sliding Mode to induce the desired behavior at this failure point (instead of getting zeno switching)

____ EXAMPLE ____
g(x) = x - 10
Lf1g = 6 - x
Lf2g = 5x

g(x) == 0   @   x=10
Plugging in x=10 for the Lie derivs test;
6-10 < 0   &&   5*10 > 0
Thus, we have zeno effect in this control system.

TO move along the surface (instead of zeno) we add a sliding behavior that activates at g(x)==0;
x_dot = (Lf2g*f1 - Lf1g*f2)/(Lf2g - Lf1g)

The sliding mode can be safely exitted once the zeno test condition is false (Lf1g < 0 && Lf2g > 0)
