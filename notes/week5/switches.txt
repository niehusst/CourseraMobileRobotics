While LTI systems can do a lot for us, it is usually not enough for real world robotics.
Up till now, we have been using a one-size-fits-all controller that we just swap the values for. Unfortuneately, robotics is not nearly that simple.

Switches in dynamics occur all the time; the dynamics of a leg changes when the foot is on and off the ground.

Controllers may switch to accomodate changing dynamics by design or by necessity.
These controller switches in behavior help robots deal with changing environments.

How do we represent a model that switches?
How do we define stability and performance since time doesnt go to infinity in just one control mode?
How do the multiple behaviors fit together? (compositionality)
Are there issues/traps with switch based systems?
