The Zeno Phenomenon is when a system causes infintely many switches (in behavior) in less than infinite time.
This is bad because you physically in the real world does not allow infinite action in less than infinite time; thus the model is inaccurate.

Type1 Zeno: infinte switches in single time instance.
Type2 Zeno: infinte switches in finite time interval.

Type1 can be detected relatively easily and can be fixed very straightforwardly. 
Type2 on the other hand, is hard to detect and fix.


Example of type1 Zeno:

x_dot = { x= 1  if y <= 0
        { x=-1  if y >  0

Since both states have a guard switch very close to 0, the system switches wildly at y==0.
