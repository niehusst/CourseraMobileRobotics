system: something that changes over time (eg. robots, stock markets)
control: influnce of the changes in systems

__ How to describe a control system __
state: what the system is CURRENTLY doing (sometimes represented as a variable)
ex= position or velocity of robo

dynamics: description of change of state as function of time
ex= possibly acceleration? how robot is moving

reference: what we want the system to do
ex= set velocity to 60mph

output: measument of some aspects of the system (we can't always measure the state, so output lets us see what happens given certain inputs)
ex= robot sensor measurments

input: control signal
ex= velocity, torques, acceleration

feedback: mapping from outputs to inputs (sometimes the difference/error between input and output)
ex= nada
