A layered architecture allows us to use x_dot=u as approximation for our robot model on the intermediary planning level while translating to the actual robot model (e.g. differential drive) on the lowest level of execution.

To build a tracker, for planned references, we can find the desired direction from input desired goal point. u = [u1, u2];
phi = atan(u2/u1)

and the velocity is
v = sqrt(u1^2 + u2^2)
