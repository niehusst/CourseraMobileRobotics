Our problem is that even with our simple robot model (not to mention a more complex one), the navigation architecture becomes complicated.
We want to find a way to reuse the simplified robot model with more realistic robot models.

Standard nav systems in robots have 3 levels:
Strategic level: where do we go (high level/long term)
where should intermediary goal points be? 
(Often uses AI, and/or graph planning. eg A*)

Operational level: where to go (low level/short term)
Which direction should we move between goal points?

Tactical level: how to get to that point
How to make our specific robot model (e.g. unicycle) get to another location. Control design.


Having a layered architecture like this allows us to separate our robots inteligence into different modules to handle different aspects of path planning.
