How do we make our theoretical models fit into the real world robots?

Assumptions:
In the dynamics, we assumed that x_dot=u (point mass)
Sensors are perfect

The assumptions about the dynamics is very wrong a lot of the time, especially since we are using a unicycle robot.
We need to create a system of conversions between our approximation with a pointmass to a real unicycle, differential drive.
