How do we make a car look like a unicycle?

Where phi is the angle between 0 and the direction of the car's body, psi is angle between phi and the angle of the steering (front wheels). l is the distance between the front and back axis. w is the angular steering velocity.

x_dot = v*cos(phi + psi)
y_dot = v*sin(phi + psi)
phi_dot = v/l * sin(psi)
psi_dot = o

States are x,y,psi,phi
inputs are o,v


To make this look like the unicycle model, we need som e curvcature control. 

The curvature in a unicycle can be expressed with 
p = v/w
where p is the radius of the turn. Curvature is;
K = w/v

In a car robot;
x_dot = p*(phi_dot + psi_dot)*cos(phi + psi)
  we know that phi_dot = v/l * sin(psi),  psi_dot = 0
  we also know that we want it to match our unicycle
  = v*cos(phi + psi), so it must be that
p = l / sin(psi)
The curvature is just the inversion.

To relate them, we just set the curvatures equal and solve for psi.
w/v = sin(psi)/l
sin(psi) = wl/v
psi = arcsin(wl/v)  #our desired steering angle

arcsin can be gross, so as long as we know that psi wont change much between dt, sin(psi) ~= psi

So we can approximate to our input, o;
o = C(wl/v - sin(psi))
