The course goals:
robot navigation using control theory
bridge theory-practice gap (do the hw)

models are necessary to predict/approximate behavior
  (make models as simple as possible)
control feedback; change behavior based on environment
stability of models
abstract architectures


________course in nutshell_________

dynamical systems as model for motion
They can be solved/tested using a initial point and the continuous equation

The dynamic drive robot model and the unicycle model can be related using simple conversion between the states of each model using conversions 

a model can be described usinga linear system (of matrices) that model the state of the robot, and adjust the the state based on the feedback

the model must be controlable, stable. 

hybrid automata can be used to let a robot change behavior.

We must be careful to watchout for zeno and edgecases when designing hybrid models with many behaviors
