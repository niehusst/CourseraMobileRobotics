To apply our v-omega based system model; we need the error and a way of controling.

e = phi_d - phi
omega = PID(e)

phi_d = arctan((y_goal - y) / (x_goal - x))


Test control rules:
1. omega = K*e
This will cause unexpected behavior because we are not accounting for the circular nature of angles.

2. omega = K * (atan2(sin(e), cos(e)))
May fail if K is too small to adjust the heading angle enough.

Make sure the K is high enough (expecially if only using a P-regulator
