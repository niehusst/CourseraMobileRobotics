Sensors are how a robot uses perception to examine the external world.
The typical skirt of sensors is IR or ultra sonic sensors. They let us measure the distance and direction from the robot to an obstacle.

An abstraction of these sensors that we use is called the Disk Abstraction. 
We can use our external sensors to determine where obstacles within its disk of sensing are.

Where d is the distance to the obstacle as measured by sensors and phi_o is the direction of the obstacle relative to the robot, the obstacle's coords are:
obst_x = x + d * cos(phi_o + phi)
obst_y = y + d * sin(phi_o + phi)



This equation system can help us solve the rendezvous problem in multi-robotics;  
If a robot senses another robot(s) in its disk, it calculates the center of gravity of the other robot(s) and goes in that direction.
