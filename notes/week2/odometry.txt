Odometry is the means by which we obtain the pose/state information.

The 2 ways we can do this:
external sensor (e.g. GPS or relative spacial parameters like laser scanners)
internal sensors contained in robot (e.g. compass, accelerometers, gyros, wheel encoders)

WHEEL ENCODER
this tool tells us how much each wheel has turned, which can tell us how far and where the robot is.
Distance info from the wheel encoders is provided as:
D = 2*pi*R*(change_tiks / N) =>
D_l, D_r, and D_c (= D_l+D_r / 2)

We can calculate updated positions and headings using the equations:

x' = x + D_c * cos(phi)
y' = y + D_c * sin(phi)
phi' = phi + (D_r - D_l) / L

One issue with this is drift. If the wheels are disconnected from the ground, they are going to have false information about the state of the robot. 
Thus, by themselves, wheel encoders are not enough to give a complete view of the world.
