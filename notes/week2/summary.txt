Example using the unicycle->differential drive models:
v = 0,   w(omega) = c
find v_r, v_l ?

using the conversion equations:
v_r = (2*v + w*L) / 2*R
v_l = (2*v - w*L) / 2*R

we can calculate
v_r = c*L / 2*R
v_l = -c*L / 2*R

From this we can see that since v_r = -v_l, the robot will just spin with this control input.


The importance of robot control models is the feedback it provides; it allows a robot to know where it is in the world and adjust to its environment.

NOTICE:
to derive the 
x' = x + D_c * cos(phi)
...

equations, we just need to examine the control systems we have been given and the taylor expansion.

x_dot = (R/2)*(v_r + v_l) * cos(phi)
D_r = R*v_r dt  #provided by wheel encoder
D_l = R*v_l dt
D_c = (D_r + D_l) / 2

notice that x_dot can be simplified to 
x_dot = D_c * cos(phi)

For a taylor expansion of x(t) ->
x(t + dt) = x(t) + x_dot*dt
   v         v       v
 updated   prev    change
   v         v       v
  x'  =      x   +  D_c*cos(phi)



Odometry example:
if robot starts at origin, where is it after 0.1 secs given 10 ticks were recorded for the right wheel and 6 for the left wheel. R=2m and N=100 ticks per revolution, L=4m.
D_r = 2*pi*R * (delta_tick_r / N)
...
use equations from above and plug and play through
