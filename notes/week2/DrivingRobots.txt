To get a robot from A to B:
we need
1. a controler
2. sensor models (how robots get info about environ)
3. robot model to predict how controler will affect robot


The controller must be able to respond to unknown, dynamic environmental conditions. To deal with diff environments, we often employ different controller types (aka behaviors)

These diff behaviors can help us abstract away the complexities of 1 big controller, by having robot goals shift in diff situations. (e.g. switch from mapping behavior to obstacle avoidance behavior)
