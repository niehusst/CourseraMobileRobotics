# Assignment 4
In this assignment, I create a couple different versions of a controller that both dodges obstacles and goes to a goal point.

Blended:
A single controller that integrates obstacles as something to avoid in the go-to-goal behavior.

Hard-Switching:
Multiple behaviors that switch on a guard condition (too close to an obst or goal has been reached).

Intermediary:
Switching behavior between pure go-to-goal and the blended controller.
